# Project-5---California-Housing-Prices

Objective Statement: The main objective of this project is to analyze the given dataset of the house prices in California and develop a predictive model to estimate the median house value. This model will help us understand the factors that could influence the house prices and provide insights for potential home buyers, sellers, and real estate investors. 

Hypothesis to prove/disprove: Median house value in California is influenced by factors such as the geographical location (longitude & latitude), housing characteristics such as (housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms), population density (population & households), and the median income of the residents. We believe that by examining these variables, we can build a model that accurately predicts the median house value and identifies the key factors driving the housing market in California.
